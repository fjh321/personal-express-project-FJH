For this app I wanted to create a movie rating app where users can submit a movie and the rating they think it deserves. Then, other users could show their agreement with certain reviews but upvoting that specific review.

What I did to build this app:
I used HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB to code this project.

I enjoyed making this app because I enjoy watching movies in almost every genre and wanted to implement something that could take into account other users' opinions in a simple way. I decided an upvote counter in the form of a CRUD PUT request would be a simple solution that would satisfy this idea. 

Lessons Learned :
* CRUD requests became more easy to decipher and implement
* window location refreshes can sometimes affect the results shown on your page/DOM
